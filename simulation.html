    </header>

    <main id="content" class="main-content" role="main">
      <h1>What is simulation lag?</h1>

      <p><b>Simulation</b> is literally everything that you see 
happening in the game. Any time a Sim gets a glass of water, when a 
toilet breaks, when a plant grows, when weather changes, when a visitor 
invades your house, the game has to plan it and execute it by simulating
 the entire process. It's a complex system that can stop working 
correctly for many different reasons.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Simulation can get overloaded with too many actions at once, which often occurs when playing the game at Speed x3.</li>
        <li>Simulation can get clogged up by conflicting actions when many different things happen at the same time.</li>
        <li>Simulation can continuously repeat actions, when something really needs to happen, which can lead to overloading.</li>
        <li>Simulation can be often interrupted by other actions taking priority and then take a while to catch up.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Although it might not seem like that's true sometimes, the game
 does the best it can with the resources it has to perform the 
simulation as smoothly as possible.</p>

      <p><b>Lag</b> can be recognized when the game still continues to 
work, yet every action takes a really long time to begin or to process. 
Sims should still be able to initiate actions, fulfill them, and finish 
performing these actions. It's when things feel sluggish or unresponsive
 for a couple of seconds.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;"><i>Simulation lag has absolutely 
nothing to do with your game graphics rendering framerate being low or 
inconsistent. That process is entirely disconnected from the game 
simulation.</i></p>

      <h1>What can cause simulation lag?</h1>
      <p>Most of the users will perceive lag as Sims slow response to 
perform actions. Sims are always attempting each and every possible 
action they can perform, on each and every possible Sim and object in 
the world and their inventory, within the limitations of their current 
situation, traits, moodlets, and relationships.</p>

      <h3>Volume of Actions</h3>
      <p>Sims are usually spawned with limited purpose and only care to 
do the things that fit the reason they were spawned for (like a 
Bartender only standing behind the bar or a random Sim walking by the 
neighborhood), which usually makes them the least lag-producing culprit.
 The opposite is true for the Sims you play as, and Sims that spawn as a
 visitor or resident, they can do everything, anywhere, with anybody and
 anything. The game limits you to a maximum of 8 playable Sims, with a 
limit of 20-ish Sims within the loaded zone. Even on a densely populated
 by objects location, this shouldn't be an issue for most computers to 
run smoothly. It's unlikely that Sims simply existing will cause major 
simulation lag, but that is something you can suspect on an older 
computer.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;"><i>Sims with a limited purpose are mostly recognizable by their role displayed as the red text above their name.</i></p>

      <h3>Intrusive Actions</h3>
      <p>Although a big number of Sims present at once might not 
immediately cause lag, their actions can. Sims always attempt to do 
something, and what they decide to do depends on their situation, 
traits, moodlets, and relationships.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sims can end up choosing to perform actions that other Sims 
are attempting to perform as well. This results in them failing, and 
that means they might stand around for a couple of seconds, waiting for 
the next attempt at doing something.</li>
        <li>Sims will very often interrupt each other, especially with 
social interactions, which often results in them standing in place and 
waiting for the other Sim to walk up to them. When you see a Sim 
standing in place for a while, it's a good guess that they are waiting 
for another Sim to reach them.</li>
        <li>Sims with limited purpose or limited environment might stand
 around doing nothing as they are waiting for an opportunity to do the 
only thing they can do. If the object or Sim they need to interact with 
is occupied, there's no space or no way to reach the intended location 
or object, or the environment doesn't provide the necessary objects to 
interact with, Sims will simply do nothing.</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;"><i>Sims themselves are a dynamic 
element that affects the world and other Sims, even if they are on the 
other side of the zone. Autonomy doesn't exactly predict what will 
happen, so it can make mistakes that result in wasted computation time.</i></p>

      <h3>Problematic Mods</h3>
      <p>Autonomy is driven by moodlets (the visible ones and the 
invisible ones). Moodlets come mostly from traits and the situation a 
Sim is in, and they provide a list of reasons why Sims should do certain
 things. These reasons are the only thing that drives Sims' 
decision-making. Autonomy looks at the available choices, picks 
something relevant and with high priority, and goes with it. If a mod 
provides a lot of these reasons, makes them often relevant and 
prioritized, it can result in other actions being frequently ignored, 
interrupted, or overridden to be a lower priority. This results in 
intended gameplay simply not working.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;"><i>It's very easy to make Sims do 
new things, but it's very hard to keep a balance that properly co-exists
 with the rest of the game. This becomes extra difficult once multiple 
mods are mixed together.</i></p>

      <h1>How to fix simulation lag?</h1>
      <p>Unfortunately, there is no magic solution for lag. Computing 
takes time, and sometimes it can take too long, resulting in lag. You 
will always have the best performance when running the game by itself, 
without any mods... but that's boring. So the best solution is to find 
the source of lag and eliminate it by removing or adjusting the mods 
that produce it. If you're not using any mods, then your best bet is to 
reduce the number of interactive objects.</p>

      <p>There is no easy way of testing specifically what could be 
affecting the performance of your game. In some cases, it's a general 
issue related to the volume of available possibilities, or it can be the
 high number of mods present in your game rather than a particularly 
problematic mod or two. The following instructions are meant to teach 
you about the basic performance of the game and pinpoint one or two mods
 that could be a source of lag.</p>

      <p>Begin by downloading and installing the <b>101 Diagnostics</b> mod. This mod will allow you to read some useful information while in-game.</p>

      <center><a class="btn" style="background-color: rgba(140,0,205,0.7);" href="https://turbodriver.github.io/TURBODRIVER_101_Diagnostics.ts4script?raw=true">Download 101 Diagnostics</a></center>

      <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;"><i>This is a TS4SCRIPT file, so place it directly into the <b>Documents\The Sims 4\Mods</b> folder.</i></p>

      <h1>How to use the <b>101 Diagnostics</b> Mod?</h1>
      <p>The <b>101 Diagnostics</b> mod displays information about the 
game state and the clicked Sim. To understand where the lag could be 
coming from, you need to understand what each displayed variable means.</p>
      <p>To display the <b>101 Diagnostics</b> dialog window, click on any Sim and find the '101 Diagnostics' option.</p>

      <p><b>Tickrate</b> (should be less than 50ms)<br>Tickrate is the 
amount of time it takes the game to process one simulation update. The 
displayed value is an average based on the last 100 simulation updates. 
Values <u>below 50ms</u> mean that the game is performing optimally. 
Anything above 100ms is considered high and indicates that the 
simulation is lagging. A high Maximum value indicates sporadic spikes of
 lag, which are fine if the average Tickrate value is below 50ms.<br><font size="0.5rem">Continue reading to learn what causes high Tickrate values.</font></p>

      <p><b>Time Speeds</b> (diagnose only when running the game at normal speed)<br>Time Speeds is a list of time speeds during which the diagnostic data was collected. You should <u>always collect diagnostic data when running the game at normal speed</u>. Running the game at a higher time speed than normal will always result in incorrect diagnostic values.<br><font size="0.5rem">Running the game at normal speed will always result in the best simulation performance.</font></p>

      <p><b>Time Desync</b> (should be less than 1500ms)<br>Time Desync 
is the amount of difference in time before processing and after 
processing of simulation. Time can get progressively desynchronized as 
simulation gets overloaded with tasks to process, which most commonly 
occurs when running the game on double or triple speed. Ideally, the 
difference of time should be 0ms, but anything below 1500ms means that 
the difference in time is less than an in-game minute. Once the time 
difference reaches 10000ms and persists for 10 seconds, the game enters 
Low-Performance Mode, slowing time down, which is most noticeable when 
running the game on triple speed for an extended period of time.<br><font size="0.5rem">Continue reading to learn what causes high Time Desync values.</font></p>

      <p><b>Runtime</b> (amount of time since last loading screen)<br>Runtime
 is the amount of time in minutes since the last loading screen, as the 
simulation resets after each loading screen. All diagnostic values 
should persist in relatively the same state, not increasing and not 
decreasing in any substantial amount, as you continue to play the game. 
Any substantial increase in any of the displayed diagnostic values could
 indicate a problem in relation to what that value represents.<br><font size="0.5rem">Continue reading to learn what certain diagnostic values represent.</font></p>

      <p><b>Time Scale</b> (should be 25ms)<br>Time Scale is the speed 
at which the game time progresses. Mods are capable of modifying the 
Time Scale values, making the game time faster or slower, which can have
 a negative impact on the simulation performance. If the Time Scale 
value is less than 25ms, the game will be running faster, which requires
 it to process simulation faster and result in high Tickrate and high 
Time Desync (lag).<br><font size="0.5rem">It's recommended not to modify the game time speed.</font></p>

      <p><b>Mods</b> (number of loaded mods)<br>Mods are usually not a 
direct source of lag, but their high number can indicate that the game 
simulation is potentially affected by it. The displayed in parentheses 
number indicates the number of loaded script mods.<br><font size="0.5rem">High number of mods that contribute to gameplay mechanics can affect simulation performance.</font></p>

      <p><b>Errors</b> (number of occurred errors)<br>Errors are a 
pretty good indicator of the game not working correctly. Although not 
all errors will impact simulation performance, a high number of errors 
will usually result in the game failing to perform all of its tasks 
which negatively affects simulation. Most of the time, errors result 
from installed Mods for reasons like outdated or broken files, outdated 
or broken code, conflicts, and incompatibility between the mods version 
and game version.<br><font size="0.5rem">Problematic mods need to be identified and updated if possible or removed.</font></p>

      <p><b>Timeline Heap</b> (number of simulation tasks)<br>Timeline Heap is the collection of all the tasks the simulation has to process. It mainly consists of <b>Active</b> element tasks, scheduled <b>Alarm</b> elements, and <b>Garbage</b>
 elements to clean. The Timeline attempts to process at least one Active
 or Alarm element which happens every simulation update (look Tickrate).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>High number of <b>Active</b> tasks combined with high 
Tickrate will result in visible lag in a form of Sims idling. Usually, 
the number of Active elements isn't higher than five times the number of
 Sims present in the world zone. Additionally, scheduled Alarms that 
repeatedly occur every 3 or fewer in-game minutes are counted as Active 
tasks due to their occurrence frequency.</li>
        <li>High number of <b>Alarms</b> doesn't have a direct impact on
 performance as these are scheduled tasks, so unless it's their time to 
run, they aren't doing anything. The exception to the rule is Alarms 
that run repeatedly every 3 or fewer in-game minutes.</li>
        <li>High number of <b>Garbage</b> elements doesn't have a direct
 impact on performance as these are a residue of Active elements that 
got rescheduled to run at a different time. These elements are cleaned 
once they occupy more than 50% of the Timeline Heap.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Due to the game processing one element per simulation update, 
if the Timeline Heap consists of many Active elements and the Tickrate 
is high, the number of Active tasks multiplied by the Tickrate can 
result in a long total processing time, which is one of the main reasons
 for Sims to idle. Otherwise, Sims might not be idle but instead of 
waiting or stuck caused by other factors.<br><font size="0.5rem">High number of Active tasks mostly comes from the high number of Sims present in the loaded world zone.</font></p>

      <p><b>Active Sims</b> (number of Sims)<br>Active Sims is the 
number of Sims that are currently present in the loaded world zone and 
the maximum number of Sims that can be present in the loaded world zone,
 which is usually 20. <b>Household</b> is the number of Sims in the household and the maximum number of Sims that can be in the household, which is by default 8. <b>World</b>
 is the total number of Sims in the entire game save and the total 
number of households in the entire game save. Usage of Mods to extend 
the limit of Sims present in the loaded world zone or in the Household 
can be a source of increased number of Timeline Heap Active Tasks which 
can result in lag.<br><font size="0.5rem">It's recommended to keep the loaded Sims limit to 20 and the household limit to 8.</font></p>

      <p><b>Active Interactions &amp; Autonomy Requests</b> (number of actions Sims are performing)<br>Sims
 that are present in the loaded world zone will request a task from the 
autonomy service, by creating an Autonomy Request, and receive that task
 which becomes their Active Interaction. Requesting an autonomy task can
 be a heavy process and it is handled by the Timeline Heap as an Active 
element. The amount of time it takes to process an Autonomy Request 
depends on the number of Active Sims and Active Objects, which are 
present in the loaded world zone. The number of Autonomy Requests 
depends on the number of Active Sims and how often they need to find a 
new task to perform.<br><font size="0.5rem">High number of Active Sims, Active Objects, and Autonomy Interactions increase the processing time of Autonomy Requests.</font></p>

      <p><b>Active Objects</b> (number of objects)<br>Active Objects is 
the number of interactive autonomous objects and the number of all 
objects (interactive and non-interactive). The interactive autonomous 
objects are the only objects present in the loaded world zone that Sims 
will attempt to interact with. <b>Autonomy Interactions</b> is the total
 of unique interactions available on interactive autonomous objects that
 are considered when performing an Autonomy Request. Sims that request 
an autonomous task will consider interacting with every available 
interactive object using every possible autonomous interaction. High 
number of interactive objects and autonomous interactions increase the 
amount of time it takes to process every Autonomy Request which can 
result in a high Tickrate. <b>Operating Objects</b> is the number of 
objects that perform a task on their own, without the involvement of 
Sims. These objects periodically or continuously perform a task (like 
growing as a plant) which is handled by the Timeline Heap as a scheduled
 Alarm element.<br><font size="0.5rem">High number of interactive 
autonomous objects and operating objects can increase the Tickrate and 
processing time of Autonomy Requests.</font></p>

      <p style="font-size: 0.9rem;"><i>Whether you use mods or not, the 
information presented above can be useful to recognize basic simulation 
issues that could lead to lag. The instructions below are mostly useful 
for users with mods.</i></p>

      <center><img src="SimulationBottom.png"></center>

      <p><b>Sim State</b> (their active interactions)<br>Sims that are 
doing something, are performing an interaction. In a simple way, 
interactions are divided into three main types - current posture, main 
task, and an optional mixer for the main task or current posture. 
Posture is Sim's current state of body, like standing, sitting, or 
swimming. The main task is something a Sim is actively doing, like 
washing hands, walking, or having a conversation. A mixer is an 
additional task to the already existing main task, like talking about 
the weather while in a conversation or doing different poses while 
looking into a mirror.</p>

      <p>If you suspect a Sim is doing something suspicious, you should 
be able to see what it is on the Sim State list. Most commonly Sims will
 stand around idle for a long time waiting for another Sim to walk up to
 them for a conversation, which can be recognized by a 'chat' or 
'social' word in the interaction name.</p>

      <p><b>Sim Situations</b> (their active situations)<br>Sims don't 
exist without a reason, unless they are currently playable. Situations 
are the main reason for a Sim to appear and perform actions, as Sims 
without a Situation will leave the loaded world zone. Every Situation 
comes with a role (displayed in parentheses) that defines Sim's purpose.
 Situations are one of the main sources of Moodlets with Gameplay 
Modifiers that adjust Sim behavior, but the names of the current 
Gameplay Modifiers might not be enough to recognize the reason for Sim 
existence and purpose.</p>

      <p>If you're questioning why a Sim has shown up and what they are 
meant to do, you should be able to see it on the Sim Situations list.</p>

      <p><b>Sim Gameplay Modifiers</b> (their active gameplay behavior modifiers for autonomy)<br>Sims
 autonomy behavior is dependent on Gameplay Modifiers that come from 
Moodlets (Buffs). Not all Moodlets come with Gameplay Modifiers, but all
 Gameplay Modifiers come from Moodlets. Most of the Moodlets that 
provide a gameplay modifier are invisible, but usually come from a 
visible source. Moodlets can be received from many different sources - 
traits, situations, relationships, interactions, weather, surroundings, 
etc. The name of the Moodlet indicates its general purpose and should be
 a decent indicator of the way it modifies autonomy behavior.</p>

      <p>If a Sim is behaving oddly, by refusing to perform certain 
activities or by prioritizing certain activities over other activities, 
you can check if there's a Moodlet that would explain it on the Sim Game
 Modifiers list. Moodlets introduced by mods have a highlighted name, as
 they may have the most impact on Sim's behavior due to imbalanced 
implementation.</p>
